# Photo-Gallery
A simple photo browser. React, Redux

Photo gallery

A simple image browser which shows images from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. 
The grid page shows 12 images at one time. Clicking a next-button leads to the next page 
which shows next 12 images. A previous-button shows 12 previous images. A home icon 
shows the first page of images. Clicking the small thumbnail-image will open details-page 
that shows particular image as a bigger version and the image title.

The responsive app was made using React and for state management
Redux and  Redux thunks for handling api - calls asynchronously and react-router for routing.
I installed Webpack more or less according to these instructions https://www.valentinog.com/blog/babel/.
